text-download-from-Internet-and-formatting
==========================================

A tiny shell script I use to download and convert text data from HTML pages and convert it to txt format for my convenience.

Dependency: curl
Install the curl binary should it not be available on your sysTelnet into an UNIX/OS X/Linux system to use it.

You only need to edit the website address to the following line, before using it:
curl -O http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2001.html

In the example (listed above) the script will download the text content (a RFC doc) from the http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2001 webpage and convert it into a .txt format. 

You can edit the necessary web address here.
