#This script takes a complete backup of my Apache web server directories and writes them onto 
#a different backup disk (mounted over USB).
#Can be invoked through a cronjob or manually.
#Once the backup is complete, the server sends an email notification.


#/srv is the default Apache directory and the /mnt/usbstick/backup is an additional (mounted) storage drive to maintain backups.


rsync --progress -r /srv/ /mnt/usbstick/backup/
